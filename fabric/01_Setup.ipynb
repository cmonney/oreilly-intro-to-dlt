    "- orderer - is the service that is independent from other nodes, orderers takes the responsibility of ordering transactions,\n",
    "- peer - node that belongs to a company/entity that has chaincodes,\n",
    "- cli - this container that contains the tools and connects the orderer and the peer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend it with a centrail authority container or build a consortium of peers, but in this example we stick to just one peer and one order to simplify it. The central authority isn't needed too, because the certificates are generated using the fabric tools and shared between the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``docker-compose.yaml`` that you have used with the setup script contains the configuration of one peer node, one orderer and the cli. We use the version 3 of docker compose configuration. In the next line we setup a new network where the three containers will be used. This configuration is based on the ``basic-network`` example from ``https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/basic-network``."

There are several environment variables set, where the most important are ``ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE`` and ``ORDERER_GENERAL_LOCALMSPDIR``. The genesis block of the orderer system channel is created and included in the configuration of the node before the node can be started. It's the first block of the chain in a channel. The local Membership Service Provider directory contains the credentials to authenticate the transactions. It's attached from our ``/crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/codete.com/orderers/orderer.codete.com/`` directory that was generated by the configuration tool that is described below."

The section ``command`` is a also different and much more complex compared to the previous configuration. It's divided into three parts. In the first one we just start the node.
